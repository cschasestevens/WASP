\usage{
sc_cc_chrd(
  ccdf,
  title1,
  title2,
  cc_type,
  col_g = NULL,
  sel_pw = NULL,
  sel_src = NULL,
  sel_tar = NULL,
  spl_pw = FALSE,
  pw,
  ph,
  fs1,
  fd1,
  lgx = 0.1,
  lgy = 0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ccdf}{A CellChat data frame generat.}

\item{title1}{Plot title, provided as a character string.}

\item{cc_type}{Type of plot to use (either "total" of "comp"). Selecting
"total" plots the total number of interactions between cell types, whereas
"comp" compares the fold difference between two treatment groups}

\item{pw}{Plot width (in cm).}

\item{ph}{Plot height (in cm).}

\item{fs1}{Font size (between 0.1 and 1).}

\item{fd1}{Gap between cell type labels and plot (generally between 1 and 3).}

\item{pw_sel}{Character string of a pathway to use for filtering the
provided CellChat object.}

\item{g_name}{Group name to split data by if cc_type is "comp."}
}
\value{
A chord diagram displaying either pathway or individual
ligand-receptor interactions.
}
\description{
Creates a chord diagram from a provided CellChat results data frame.
}
