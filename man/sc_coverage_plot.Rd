\usage{
sc_coverage_plot(
  so,
  dref,
  asy1 = "ufy.peaks",
  asy2 = "RNA",
  asy_dat = "scale.data",
  g_name,
  g_region = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{so}{Input Seurat Object.}

\item{dref}{Path to a .gtf file containing reference gene annotations.}

\item{asy1}{ATAC peaks assay to use.}

\item{asy2}{GEX assay to use.}

\item{g_name}{Gene or region to plot, provided as a character string.}

\item{g_region}{(optional) Region within the coverage plot to highlight.}

\item{bp_window}{Vector containing the upstream and downstream limits
for extending the plotting window (in base pairs).}

\item{ct_col}{Cell type column name to use in the selected Seurat object.
Must be a factor variable.}

\item{ct_spl}{Logical indicating whether cell types should be stratified
by an additional variable.}

\item{ct_sel}{Pattern for selecting individual cell types if ct_spl == TRUE.}

\item{md_list1}{Name of variable to split by group.}

\item{p_type}{Final coverage plot type
(either "ct_only", "gn_only", or "gn_ct");
Note that "gn_only" and "gn_ct" use the variable
from md_list1 for plotting. This can be useful for summarizing differences
in accessbility between treatment groups.}
}
\value{
A coverage plot including the specified gene track and all other
genes present within the specified window.
}
\description{
Generates a coverage plot from a Signac ChromatinAssay.
Requires scATAC-Seq peak information and a reference GRanges object
for plotting gene positions. The Signac function CoveragePlot() is
used to generate the final plot.
