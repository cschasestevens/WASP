# WASP v4.02 (20251028)

Processing and Analysis of Single-cell RNA-Sequencing and Single-cell ATAC-Sequencing Datasets

## Description

Incorporates Seurat and Signac with various R packages to perform processing and analysis of single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq), single-cell ATAC-Sequencing (scATAC-Seq), or combined 10X Multiome datasets.    The functions included in this package provide a comprehensive workflow for integrating commonly used Seurat and Signac functions with advanced statistical methods and visualization.    Most analyses can be run in parallel using intuitive functions to expedite time-consuming steps such as dataset integration and differential expression analysis.    The package is compatible with Windows, Linux, or WSL2. However, analyses conducted in Windows default to sequential processing due to inherent stability issues of parallel processing in Windows.

* Important: Functions run in Linux or WSL2 require installation of additional dependencies and setup of a conda environment. PhenoCycler analysis functions have been removed from this package and are now available as a standalone package at cschasestevens/STIngPC.
